Abstract: 
- "On the contrary, diffusive memristor functions" should be "diffusive memristors function"

Introduction:
- "Within this trend, spiking artificial neuron is an important component required in most neuromorphic computing system" => should be 
"within this trend, the spiking artificial neuron is an important component required in most neuromorphic computing systems"

- "Sampling and analog-digital-conversion circuits are needed in these systems for analogue signal processing, and extra 
logics and memories are required to add neuronal functions to these systems" => should be

and memory is required to add neuronal functions to these systems"

- "Diffusive memristor is a type of volatile memristor based on ion migration" => should be
"The Diffusive memristor is a type of volatile memristor based on ion migration"

- "Moreover, the movement of ion inside diffusive memristor shows" => should be 
"Moreover, the movement of ions inside diffusive memristors show"

- "Electrolyte ions in biological neurons move between intracellular and extracellular under diffusion force and ion channel
regulation , while metal ions in diffusive memristor move between top electrode and bottom electrode under diffusion and
drift activities" => should be
"Electrolyte ions in biological neurons move between intracellular and extracellular fluid due to diffusion forces and ion-channel
regulation, while metal ions in diffusive memristors move between their top electrode and bottom electrode due to diffusion and 
drift activities"
