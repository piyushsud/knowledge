    "    ○ Filters before the mixer have a relatively large BW. Most filtering is done at the IF, so the Q value requirement is lower.\n",

    "- Choose the LO so that the carrier frequency of interest is mixed to the desired IF. For example, if we want to tune to 99.7 MHz and we want an IF of 10.7 MHz, then we should set the LO to 90 MHz.\n",
