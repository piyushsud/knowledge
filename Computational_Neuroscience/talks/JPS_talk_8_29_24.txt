- There are many device implementaitons for optimzation problems, e.g. local search
- goal in optimization problem is to find x that minimizes E, but in a non-convex space you can't use gradient descent
- ising model of spins - np complete, so any problem in NP can be mapped to it => Ising machine community is growing.
- Ising energy is sum of all weighted i and j sums and some factor*i.
- Lots of algorithms inject noise to avoid local minimums.
- Solver is a dynamical system, change s in time towards lower energies as effective temp goes to 0.
- Ising model also called QUBO.
- Example: 3SAT
- When there are many more clauses than variables, the problem becomes much harder.
- Can convert 3SAT into a minimizing energy/loss function.
- Replace x1x2x3 with y = x1*x2, and add a penalty term to constrain 
- In memory computing - memristor crossbars for high parallelism
- Changning peripheral circuits can be used to address various problems/algorithms
- Challenges - memristors not readily available, state fluctations and drift can limit multi-bit capabilities, reprogramming is higher energy and slower than sram
- extrapolating system to 16 nm, time to solution is much faster (not actually implemented but projected)
- problem: new auxilary variables change complexity from 2N to 2^4.25N.
- solution: cahnged QUBO to PUBO (Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization)
- Additional circuits to deal with ternary circuits, larger crossbar area (although sparse so not that bad), but benefit is that reduced polynomials
- Less RRAM area, but more CMOS
- Error was dominated by cmos process variations
- QUBO is essetnially simulated annealing, and PUBO requires a different algorithm 
- Even more improvements: WalkSAT Solver
- Implemented WalkSAT heurisitic algorithm using memristor crossbar and mixed analog/digital circuit
- Complexity is independent of problem order K
- For WalkSAT solver, Hamming distance is computed, for which memristor crossbar is used. Digital circuits are used for
threshold functions and random number generators.
- RAM vs. CAM
- CAM systems - you feed in data, and if there's a match then it gives you the address. Some CAMs also have don't cares.
- Analog/memristor based CAMs were used to speed up performance.
- Analog CAM stores intervals instead of values
- Temperature range was 0C-60C
